Web development refers to the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. 
It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.
Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
While web development typically refers to web markup and coding, website development includes all related development tasks, such as client-side scripting, server-side scripting, server and network security configuration, eCommerce development, and content management system (CMS) development.
The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.
There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code.
A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager.
