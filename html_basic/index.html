<p>
    HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the fundamental language of the World Wide Web.
    It is the cornerstone of web development, serving as the standard for creating and 
    structuring web content. HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning
    it describes the structure and presentation of web documents rather than executing 
    complex algorithms.
    </p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>
    HTML provides a structured way to organise content on a webpage. 
    It uses a system of tags enclosed in angle brackets to define elements 
    such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and more.
    This structured approach allows web browsers to interpret and display 
    content correctly, ensuring consistency across different devices and platforms.
</p>

<h2>Hypertext</h2>
<p>
    HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language," highlighting its role in creating 
    hypertext documents. Hypertext refers to text containing links to other documents 
    or resources, allowing users to navigate the web by simply clicking on links. HTML's 
    anchor tags (< a >) are used to create hyperlinks, enabling users to access different
    web pages, multimedia, and resources easily.
</p>

 <h2>Semantics</h2>
 <p>
    HTML also emphasises semantic markup, which means using tags that convey the 
    meaning and purpose of the content rather than focusing solely on appearance. 
    Semantic HTML tags, such as < header >, < nav >, < article >, and < footer >,
    help improve accessibility and search engine optimisation (SEO) while making it easier for
    developers to understand the content's structure.
</p>

<h2>Evolution</h2>
<p>
    HTML has undergone several versions and iterations since its inception in the early 1990s.
    The most recent major version is HTML5, which introduced numerous new elements and features
    to enhance web development. HTML5 brought native support for multimedia components like 
    audio and video, improved form controls, and introduced the HTML Document Object Model (DOM)
    concept, enabling dynamic web applications with JavaScript.
