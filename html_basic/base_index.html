    <h1>Introduction to HTML </h1><i>BY HUMPHREY NYAHOJA</i><br>
    <p>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <br>
        It is the standard markup language for creating web pages. <br>
        HTML describes the structure of a web page and consists of a series of elements<br>
         that label pieces of content such as headings, paragraphs, links, etc. <br>
         HTML is used to structure content and define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. <br>
         HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format.<br> 
         HTML is the first language you should learn if you want to go for web development. <br>
         HTML is a combination of both hypertext and markup language. <br>
         It contains the elements that can change/develop a web page’s look and the displayed contents. <br>
         HTML is all about structuring the data. <br>
        It doesn’t concern itself with how something looks; that’s what CSS is for. <br>
